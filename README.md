vim-chat
========

This is a vim syntax file for the [CHAT transcription format](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/chat.pdf), which is used in many spoken language corpora, such as [CHILDES](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/), [TalkBank](http://talkbank.org/), and [SBCSAE](http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/research/santa-barbara-corpus).

This is very much a work in progress, as I slowly work my way through the [spec](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/chat.pdf) and through corpus data.
